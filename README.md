In June 1993 Harriet died of cancer at the age of 44. Harrietâ€™s peaceful death and the care she received inspired the development of the Spiritual Care Education Programme and the building of the Spiritual Care Centre at Dzogchen Beara.

Rigpa undertook a series of reforms throughout the organisation, following the retirement of Sogyal Rinpoche in August 2017, and serious allegations and complaints against him and Rigpa. These allegations were investigated and an independent report was published in September 2018. We continue to act upon the recommendations of this report, details of which can be read by clicking here, along with press statements and more information about changes in Rigpa.

Sogyal Rinpoche passed away on Wednesday 28 August 2019, following complications during cancer treatment.

The main aim of this project is to incourage people to vist Dzoghen Beara and to get vital feedback on their stay
